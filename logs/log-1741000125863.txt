ability to do the kinds of things that make you happier The Mental Cost of Chasi
ng Happiness Maglio likens the exhaustion of happiness seeking to coming home af
ter a grueling day at work When we re mentally drained we re more likely to skip
 the gym order takeout instead of cooking or binge watch TV instead of spending 
time with loved ones These small self defeating choices can add up leaving us fe
eling less happy overall The researchers surveyed hundreds of people and found t
hat those who habitually tried to be happier reported using less self control in
 their daily lives Maglio and his co author Aekyoung Kim of the University of Sy
dney hypothesized that happiness seeking and self control compete for the same f
inite pool of mental energy To test this they designed a series of experiments I
n one study participants were asked to rank lists of objects a mundane task that
 nevertheless requires mental focus and self regulation The more people reported
 striving for happiness the less time they spent on the task Another experiment 
used ads with the word happiness to trigger a subconscious desire to feel happie
r Participants who saw these ads were then given a bowl of chocolates and told t
hey could eat as many as they liked Those exposed to the happiness prime ate sig
nificantly more chocolates than their counterparts suggesting they had less self
 control to resist temptation Don t you want to get smarter every day Stay ahead

is happiness seeking uniquely exhausting or would chasing any goal have the same
 effect To answer this the researchers divided participants into two groups The 
participants had to choose between pairs of everyday objects One group was asked
 to make choices based on what would make them happier while the other group cho
se based on personal preference Both groups then completed a mental task to gaug
e their self control The happiness biased group quit earlier indicating they had
 fewer mental resources left after their pursuit Rethinking Happiness Maglio is 
quick to clarify that the pursuit of happiness isn t inherently futile The probl
em he says lies in how we think about happiness Many people treat it like a comm
odity something to be accumulated and hoarded But happiness he argues is more li

t the harder you hold the more your hand will cramp he says Eventually you ll ha
ve to let go Instead of relentlessly chasing happiness Maglio suggests a simpler
 approach appreciate what you already have Just chill Don t try to be super happ
y all the time he says Instead of trying to get more stuff you want look at what
 you already have and just accept it as something that gives you happiness This 
research comes at a time when the pressure to be happy has never been greater So
