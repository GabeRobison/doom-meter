aulted in teen s death investigation says A state inspector general s report als
o finds the facility did not seek parental approval before administering medicat

t Share Listen A state investigation has concluded that the correctional facilit
y in Red Wing violated four correctional standards in the lead up to the death o
f a juvenile last fall The violations revealed in a Corrections Department repor
t earlier this year by the department s inspector general s office included fail
ing to properly conduct well being checks the night the juvenile was found unres
ponsive The report also states that the facility did not seek permission from a 
parent or guardian before administering an unspecified medication to the inmate 
The year old was found dead on Oct The Southern Minnesota Regional Medical Exami
ner s Office ruled the death a suicide According to the investigation In the ove
rnight hours leading up to the death staff were documented on camera conducting 
well being checks lasting about second each While the checks were completed with
in the required minute timeframes the report concluded that the brevity of the v
isits would not have allowed a reasonable person to ensure the safety and well b
eing of residents State policy requires juvenile security staff to look for any 
unusual movement ensure breathing and see the person s skin during well being ch
ecks In addition the investigation found that the day before the death the facil
ity failed to document the whereabouts of the juvenile for an hour between about
 and p m The facility was also found to be in violation of a state statute requi
ring background checks on any facility serving children or youth The inspector g
eneral s office said a staff member who was on duty at the time of the death had
 failed to cooperate with background requirements The facility had been notified
 more than a year earlier that the staff member needed to be removed from his po
sition immediately The Red Wing detention center has since taken corrective acti
ons in response to the death review including retraining staff on the requiremen
ts of conducting well being checks Since January all but one staff member have r
eceived the training a department spokesperson said Since the Red Wing death rev
iew the assigned inspector has been monitoring all aspects the of compliance wit
