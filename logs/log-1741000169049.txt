 photos of her cat Tigrik which translates to little tiger in English Knowing th
at the kitten had a rough start in life we asked Viktoria to share his story wit
h us Here s what we found out Early one morning someone in our building s chat s
hared a message about kittens abandoned in a box among the garbage When I arrive
d I found two tiny kittens barely alive lying on dirty rags I took them home fed
 them and examined them their eyes were sealed shut with pus and infection That 
same day I brought them to the vet where we learned their genders and received a
 treatment plan As we cared for them my husband and I realized we couldn t part 
with Tigrik After their eye infections healed we decided to keep him while his b
rother went to live with my sister Both kittens were very sick but Tigrik was in
 critical condition He had panleukopenia a disease that kills of kittens under a
 year old His symptoms were severe and I feared they wouldn t survive On top of 
that they had lice worms fleas and ringworm More recently they were diagnosed wi
th coronavirus enteritis Despite everything the kittens fought through each illn
ess and are now happy healthy and full of energy They eat high quality food and 
are playful and active Image credits Image credits Looking at Tigrik s transform
ation we can t help but get emotional Rescuing pets in need is a noble act and s
eeing this once fragile kitten thrive in his forever home is truly a happy endin
g We asked Viktoria what emotions or memories the before and after photos bring 
back for her and she responded When the kittens were sick we cried a lot fearing
 they wouldn t survive Now we try not to dwell on those moments but whenever I t
ell their story I still get emotional Image credits Image credits Now we wanted 
to learn more about the fully grown beautiful cat Tigrik We were curious about h
is habits and funny behaviors and his owner kindly shared with us He wakes up wi
th us in the morning runs to eat and then watches us as we get ready for work be
fore going back to sleep In the evening when my husband comes home we play with 
him until late at night He loves jingling toys and climbing vertically on walls 
and sofas Of course he scratched up a lot of things at first but over time we ma
naged to fix everything She also added On weekends we sleep in with Tigrik until
 lunchtime Image credits Image credits Lastly Smolyanova shared some advice for 
other cat owners who want to document their pet s growth Take plenty of memorabl
e photos It would be great to print them in an album though I know I probably wo
n t get around to doing it myself Image credits Image credits Image credits Imag
