ter storage Wilson said One well known computer model indicated a global drought
 but it was unclear if it was accurate The study s findings though he said confi
rm the observation and will help better refine models Soil moisture continued to
 decrease following although not at that same intense rate Satellite observation
s from NASA s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment showed about another gigat
ons of water on land depleted from to which is about the equivalent of millimete
rs of global mean sea level rise There is continuing loss of moisture of water s
tored on land Wilson said In our perspective of human timescales we may not have
 seen the kind of rainfall events that would be important in recharging the land
 Evidence of a global shift in water storage Tracking Earth s global water stora
ge on land is not an easy feat Scientists were long restricted to regional measu
rements and models but then the launch of GRACE allowed for new global views of 
water storage from the surface to below ground But it only launched in leaving s
cientists in the dark on what it looked like in prior decades In the new study S
eo and his colleagues extend this record back to and provided the first evidence
 of a permanent shift in Earth s hydrological cycle due to climate change said h
ydrologist Luis Samaniego who was not involved in the study and wrote a review a
rticle on the research Since direct observations of global water storage on land
 were scarce before the team looked at two other longer datasets as indicators g
lobal sea level rise and Earth s tilt Global sea level rise is largely fed by th
e melting of glaciers and ice sheets but it is also affected by changing the amo
unt of water on land When water leaves the continents it ends up in the oceans F
amiglietti said At the same time moving water from one part of Earth to another 
can affect the planet s rotation around its axis Earth spins on an imaginary lin
e between the North and South poles but the exact position of the line isn t fix
ed The points where Earth s axis of rotation meets Earth s surface wobbles and d
rifts a few meters each year called polar motion These changes aren t noticeable
 to people but is perceptible by GPS systems on phones Previously Famiglietti an
d his same colleagues found removing groundwater shifted Earth s tilt inches eas
tward In the new study the team also found polar motion underwent observable cha
nges from global groundwater loss from to Samaniego said the new study validates
 a long term trend of Earth s water cycle seen in models with not just one but t
hree completely independent global datasets an impressive scientific feat These 
declines have been seen on a regional level but he said this is the first conclu
sive evidence of a global shift in water storage As of the team said soil moistu
re still has not recovered and likely won t under the current climate conditions
 Prolonged droughts which are increasing in a warming world will prevent soil mo
isture from bouncing back on the given c
